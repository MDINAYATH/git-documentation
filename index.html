    <h1>GIT (GLOBAL INFORMATION
        TRACKER):</h1>
        <p>Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) commonly used for managing and tracking
            changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate
            on a project by managing dierent versions of les, making it easier to track history, merge
            changes, and resolve conicts.</p>
           <u><mark><h2>Key Features of Git:</h2></mark></u>
            <strong>1. Distributed Version Control:</strong> <p>Unlike centralized version control systems, Git allows every
                developer to have a complete copy of the entire repository, including the history, on their local
                machine.</p>
            <strong>2. Branching and Merging:</strong><p> Git makes it easy to create branches, allowing developers to work on
                dierent features or xes independently. Afterward, they can merge changes back into the main
                branch.</p>
                <strong>3. Commit History:</strong><p>Every change in a Git repository is saved as a "commit," which records a
                    snapshot of the les at that point in time.</p>
                    <strong>4. Collaboration:</strong><p> Git supports collaborative workows through the use of remote repositories
                        (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), where multiple developers can push changes and pull updates</p>
<strong>5. Staging Area:</strong><p>Git has a staging area where changes can be reviewed before being committed.
    This allows users to selectively commit changes.</p>
    <u><h2>Basic Git Commands:</h2></u>
<strong>git init: </strong> Initialize a new Git repository.<br>
<strong> git clone :</strong>Clone an existing repository to your local machine.<br>
<strong> git status: </strong>: View the current status of your working directory and staging area.<br>
    <strong>git add <le> / Add . : </strong>d changes to the staging area before committing.<br>
        <strong> git commit -m "message":</strong>: Commit changes with a message.<br>
        <strong> git push: </strong>Push committed changes to a remote repository.<br>
 <strong> git branch: </strong>List or create branches.<br>
 <strong> git remote add origin main:</strong> To link the repository and local file.<br>
<strong>git push -u origin main:</strong> to push the local le into remote.
<u><h2>GIT HUB:</h2></u><p>GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting and managing Git repositories. It provides a webbased interface for users to collaborate on projects, share code, and track version history, making
    it a popular choice for developers and teams worldwide. GitHub adds features on top of Git to
    facilitate collaboration, project management, and community engagement. </p>
    <u><h2>Key Features of GitHub:</h2></u>
    <strong>1. Repository Hosting:</strong>: GitHub hosts Git repositories, making it easy to share and collaborate on
    code. Repositories can be public (open to everyone) or private (restricted access).<br>
    <strong>2. Collaboration Tools:</strong> GitHub oers a range of tools for collaboration, including:
    a. Pull Requests: Developers can propose changes to a project by submitting a pull request (PR).
    Other collaborators review the changes before merging them into the main branch.<br>
    <strong>3. GitHub Actions: </strong>: Automate workows with GitHub Actions, a powerful CI/CD (continuous
    integration/continuous delivery) tool. You can automate testing, building, deployment, and other
    tasks whenever changes are made to the code.<br><strong>4. Documentation:</strong> GitHub oers features like README.md les, wikis, and GitHub Pages for
    hosting project documentation directly from repositories.<br><strong>5. Security and Code Scanning:</strong>GitHub oers tools like code scanning and secret scanning to
    help developers nd vulnerabilities or potential security issues in their codebase.<br><strong>6. GitHub Pages: </strong> This feature allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub
    repository, making it easy to create personal websites, blogs, or project documentation.<br>
    <strong>7. Team and Organization Management</strong>: For larger teams and organizations, GitHub provides
    features like user roles, permissions, and access control to manage team workows and
    repositories eciently.
